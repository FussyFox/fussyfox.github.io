# Fussy Fox

Make your reviews about content and your CI suite about tests.
Let us worry about style ðŸ˜Ž

Fussy Fox provides a variety of static code analytic services.
We use AWS Lambda to provide coders with lightning fast feedback on each commit.

### Setup

The setup is simple. Just add a file config file to your repository specifying
which linters you want to run.

The configuration is stored in a simple YAML format in a file named
`.checks.yml`.

Sample config: `.checks.yml`

```YAML
- bandit
- flake8
- isort
```
