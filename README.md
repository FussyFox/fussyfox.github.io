# Fussy Fox

_Fussy Fox is a real-time code linting platform for GitHub_

Make your reviews about content and your CI suite about tests.
Let us worry about style ðŸ˜Ž

Fussy Fox provides a variety of static code analytic services.
We use AWS Lambda to provide coders with lightning fast feedback on each commit.

### Setup

The setup is simple. Just add a file config file to your repository specifying
which linters you want to run.

The configuration is stored in a simple YAML format in a file named
`.checks.yml`.

Sample config: `.checks.yml`

```YAML
- bandit
- flake8
- isort
```

### Privacy

FussyFox has a very simple yet strict privacy policy to give our users the
security they deserve.

We don't collect or store any information, that is not required to provide an
excellent service. Furthermore we don't store any information longer than
necessary.

As a result, we are not collecting or story any private information for more
then 5 minutes, the max. execution time of a check. We also don't retain server
logs for more than 30 days.

Also all our software is open source, you are welcome to verify that we do good
on those promised and alert us if we made a mistake. In those cases please
reach out to security@johanneshoppe.com

What about **GDPR**? â€” Since we don't store any information that isn't needed
and never longer than 30 days, we follow the GDRP requirements.

That being said, here comes the boring legal part:
